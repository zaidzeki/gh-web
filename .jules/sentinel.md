## 2025-05-14 - Partial Path Traversal in Workspace Validation
**Vulnerability:** Path validation using `startswith` allowed access to sibling directories with a common prefix (e.g., `/tmp/repo` allowed access to `/tmp/repo-secret`).
**Learning:** `startswith` only performs string comparison and does not respect directory boundaries in path strings.
**Prevention:** Use `os.path.commonpath` to verify that a path is a subpath of another, as it correctly handles path components.
